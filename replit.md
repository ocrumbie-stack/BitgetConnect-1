# Recent Changes
**Comprehensive 14-Indicator Scoring System (Latest)**: Enhanced AI bot entry evaluation from 9 to 14 technical indicators with rebalanced 100-point scoring system for better signal quality understanding. New indicators include: Ichimoku Cloud (10pts), MFI - Money Flow Index (7pts), OBV - On-Balance Volume (7pts), Fibonacci Retracement (6pts), and Parabolic SAR (3pts). Rebalanced existing weights: EMA (12), HTF Confirmation (12), RSI (8), MACD (8), ADX (8), Stochastic (6), Volume Z-Score (6), VWAP (5), Supertrend (2). All indicators total exactly 100 points for clearer entry quality assessment. Each indicator includes comprehensive calculation functions, scoring logic, and proper error handling. System automatically uses all 14 indicators for AI bot signal generation without requiring user configuration.

**User-Specific API Credentials System**: Completely removed hardcoded Bitget API credentials and implemented secure user-specific credential management. Users now configure their own API keys through the settings page, ensuring personal account security and eliminating shared credential risks. System now shows "No user API credentials found" message until users configure their own credentials.

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Table design preference: Compact rows with minimal padding (py-2) for space efficiency while maintaining readability.
Navigation preference: Pages should open instantly at the top without scrolling animations for immediate access to content.
Performance optimization preference: Smooth scrolling performance is critical - heavy calculations should be lazy-loaded and memoized to prevent UI blocking during navigation. Virtual scrolling with limited visible items (50 max) ensures responsive interactions.
Bots page UX preference: Use clickable overview cards for navigation instead of redundant tab system - streamlined interface with functional cards that show active states.
Folder organization preference: All bots should be automatically assigned to appropriate folders without requiring manual organization buttons. Users want seamless automatic categorization by deployment type (auto scanner, manual strategy, folder deployment, etc.) without any manual intervention.
Interface preference: Clean, minimal interface without unnecessary alerts or notification buttons on main pages - keep only essential functionality visible.
Account balance display: Total Balance = Total Equity + Available Balance + P&L (complete account value including position allocations).
Header structure preference: Total Balance, Total Equity, Available Balance (in that specific order).
Balance calculation logic: FIXED - Total Equity = Margin Used + PnL, Total Balance = Available Balance + Total Equity (complete account value).
Bot page layout preference: Improved two-row vertical design for better mobile display and proper element fitting. Financial data displays in vertical stacks, folder headers use two-row layout to prevent overflow, and all elements properly fit within screen width. Layout shift completely eliminated by removing hover scale effects and using transition-colors only with fixed min-height cards. Header made sticky with z-index for better navigation and overflow-x-hidden prevents horizontal scrolling issues.
Card positioning preference: Balance card positioned beside P&L card in separate row below Market Scanner (not in same grid space). Uses 2-column grid layout for optimal space utilization with proper visual separation.
Multi-bucket volatility classification system: Sophisticated 3-bucket analysis system with comprehensive technical criteria: Aggressive, Balanced, and Conservative.
Auto scanner multi-timeframe integration: Scanner automatically uses dual timeframe analysis based on selected trading style. Primary timeframe provides detailed technical analysis while secondary timeframe offers confirmation. No manual configuration required - settings apply instantly upon style selection.
Bot termination system: Comprehensive bot termination that closes both Bitget positions AND terminates corresponding bot database records.
Strategy Edit System: FULLY FUNCTIONAL strategy editing with complete form pre-population, dynamic dialog titles, proper state management, and successful API integration. Edit button opens populated form dialog, allows modifications, and saves changes via PUT endpoint.
Enhanced Indicator Conditions: FULLY EXPANDED condition options for all 8 indicators. All indicators feature comprehensive calculation functions, evaluation logic, and complete frontend-backend integration with proper error handling and logging. Input fields now properly support value clearing.
Entry system preference: ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE account protection system implemented after previous system caused consistent losses. New safety requirements, revised indicator weights, and account protection measures. System now trades much less frequently but with higher win rates and proper risk management to prevent account destruction.
Auto Market Scanner: FULLY OPERATIONAL AND FIXED - focused scanning system that analyzes TOP 50 HIGHEST-VOLUME USDT pairs from Bitget API. Optimized for 10x faster performance while maintaining higher signal quality through volume-based filtering. Uses realistic confidence thresholds and signal differences. Successfully finds high-confidence trading opportunities. Automatically selects optimal opportunities using multi-indicator AI analysis and deploys bots with capital allocation. Configurable parameters for maximum bots (3-10, increased default to 10), realistic confidence thresholds, and automatic capital distribution across selected opportunities. ENHANCED CONCURRENT POSITIONS: System now supports up to 10 concurrent active positions by default (increased from 5) for better portfolio diversification and trading opportunity capture.
Comprehensive Folder-Based Organization System: FULLY IMPLEMENTED automatic folder organization for ALL bot deployments with smart categorization by deployment type. System features automated folder creation with timestamped naming conventions, intelligent reuse of existing folders for similar deployments. All new deployments automatically assign appropriate folders based on deployment type with detailed descriptions and color-coded organization. System works seamlessly without manual intervention. Backend logic handles folder assignment automatically based on deployment type and strategy configuration.
AI Bot Deployment System: FULLY RESTORED comprehensive deployment dialog with three deployment modes: Single Trading Pair, Folder Deployment, and Auto Market Scanner. Features complete capital/leverage configuration, conditional UI based on selected mode, and full integration with existing handleRunStrategy backend logic. Trading Style Selector now collapsible with compact summary view showing key settings.
Sophisticated Entry Point Analysis: FULLY IMPLEMENTED advanced entry system based on detailed trading rules document. Features bucket-specific entry strategies: Balanced, Aggressive, and Conservative. All entries include comprehensive safety scoring, dynamic stop loss/take profit calculations, invalidation rules, and ultra-conservative account protection measures. Entry system is completely separate from market scanning - scanner finds opportunities, entry determines exact entry points with maximum 1-2 day hold times.
Auto Market Scanner UI Organization: Reorganized with proper card separation - Scanner Configuration card contains trading style selector, max bots setting, and start scanner button. Scanner Results & Deployment card contains capital allocation, leverage settings, and deploy button for found opportunities. Removed duplicate leverage settings from trading style selector to keep leverage configuration only in deployment section.
Markets Page Performance Optimization: FULLY OPTIMIZED for smooth scrolling performance. Implemented lazy-loading AI opportunity calculations, memoized data filtering/sorting operations, virtual scrolling with 50-item limit, optimized API request frequency, and resolved React hooks order violations. Navigation between pages now instant with no blocking calculations during scroll interactions.
Trade Selection Philosophy: Prioritizes HIGH-VOLATILITY pairs that can achieve minimum 5% leveraged gains with smaller percentage moves. System automatically identifies volatile pairs (>2% daily movement) and adjusts entry requirements accordingly. Focus on volatile meme tokens, small caps, and trending altcoins for quick scalping opportunities. Enhanced market scanner requires minimum 0.8% moves to identify truly volatile opportunities.
Dynamic Exit Visualizer Design Standards: ESTABLISHED DESIGN SYSTEM for consistent modal/popup components throughout the app. Key design elements: Simple white/dark gray card with `max-w-md` size and `rounded-lg` corners, no fancy gradients or headers. Clean two-badge layout for primary data (ROI percentage + risk level) using large badges with proper color coding. Simple progress section with clear "Stop Loss"/"Take Profit" labels and 6px height progress bar. Minimal trading info with centered pair name and entry/current prices. Single action button for primary function with two-step confirmation pattern. Clean spacing using `space-y-6` for main sections and `p-6` padding. Border separations using subtle gray borders. This design pattern should be replicated for any modal, popup, or overlay component to maintain visual consistency across the trading platform.

# System Architecture
## UI/UX Decisions
The application features a clean, professional mobile-optimized design with a bottom navigation bar, collapsible folder views, and intuitive interfaces, ensuring visual consistency through `shadcn/ui` components. AI-powered features include color-coded risk levels, confidence ratings, and strategy-specific icons. A consistent design system is established for all modals and popups, featuring clean layouts and clear data representation.

## Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite, using Tailwind CSS with `shadcn/ui` for a mobile-first responsive design. State management uses React Query for server state and Wouter for client-side routing. Real-time updates are facilitated via WebSocket. The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript, integrating with the Bitget API, and provides a WebSocket server. Data is primarily stored in-memory with an `IStorage` interface, designed for future PostgreSQL integration with Drizzle ORM. Key technical implementations include real-time data streaming, comprehensive trading pair organization, an AI-powered trading opportunity recommendation system, reusable strategy templates, an enhanced multi-bucket analysis system for volatility classification, a dynamic leverage safety system, and sophisticated entry point analysis.
