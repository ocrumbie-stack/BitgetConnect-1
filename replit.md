# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Table design preference: Compact rows with minimal padding (py-2) for space efficiency while maintaining readability.
Navigation preference: Pages should open instantly at the top without scrolling animations for immediate access to content.
Bots page UX preference: Use clickable overview cards for navigation instead of redundant tab system - streamlined interface with functional cards that show active states.
Account balance display: Total Balance = Total Equity + Available Balance + P&L (complete account value including position allocations).
Header structure preference: Total Balance, Total Equity, Available Balance (in that specific order).
Balance calculation logic: Total Equity = Available Balance + Margin Used, Total Balance = Total Equity + Available Balance + P&L.
Bot page layout preference: Fixed layout issues in active execution tab with improved two-row vertical design for better mobile display and proper element fitting (August 2025). Successfully resolved horizontal scrolling issues on mobile devices - financial data now displays in vertical stacks, folder headers use two-row layout to prevent overflow, and all elements properly fit within screen width (August 2025).
Bot termination system: Successfully implemented comprehensive bot termination that closes both Bitget positions AND terminates corresponding bot database records. "Close All Positions" button now works completely - no more ghost bots appearing after termination. Both individual Stop buttons and bulk termination properly filter out terminated bots from the UI display. Fixed critical synchronization issue where bots with active Bitget positions showed as "waiting_entry" instead of "active" due to missing exit criteria for folder-deployed bots - now properly detects and displays all bots with live positions (August 2025).
Entry system preference: Evolved from MACD-only to comprehensive multi-indicator analysis system. AI bots now use weighted technical analysis combining MACD (25%), RSI (20%), Bollinger Bands (20%), Volume Analysis (15%), Moving Averages (10%), and Support/Resistance (10%) with adaptive confidence thresholds for signal generation. Enhanced with dynamic thresholds (25-50%) based on signal strength, directional clarity, and high-conviction indicators. System fully supports both long and short positions with proper directional scoring and order execution. Successfully executing live trades with enhanced threshold system (August 2025).
Auto Market Scanner: FULLY OPERATIONAL autonomous market-wide scanning system that evaluates 100+ trading pairs, automatically selects optimal opportunities using multi-indicator AI analysis, and deploys bots with just capital allocation required from user. Features configurable parameters for maximum bots (3-10), minimum confidence threshold (30-90%), and automatic capital distribution across selected opportunities. Successfully resolved volume field mapping issue from volume24h to quoteVolume for proper Bitget API integration. CONFIRMED LIVE TRADING: Successfully executing real trades with enhanced AI signal detection and adaptive confidence thresholds (25-50%). Enhanced with organized folder structure - auto-scanner trades now appear in dedicated "ðŸ¤– Auto Market Scanner" collapsible section with bulk management capabilities, confidence level display, direction indicators (LONG/SHORT), and clean separation from manual/folder bots. BREAKTHROUGH CONFIRMED: Auto-scanner bots properly transition from "waiting_entry" to "active" status when trades execute. Live examples: BASUSDT executed at 35% confidence, TRXUSDT triggered SHORT at 25% confidence. Complete UI organization implemented August 28, 2025.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for mobile-first, responsive design. State management uses React Query for server state and caching, and Wouter for client-side routing. Real-time updates are via WebSocket. The application has a component-based structure, organized around a bottom navigation bar with five main sections: Home, Markets, Trade, Bot, and Assets.

## Backend Architecture
The server-side uses Express.js with TypeScript. It integrates with the Bitget API for futures market data and provides a WebSocket server for live updates. Data is currently stored in-memory, designed with an abstract `IStorage` interface for future database integration. Account balance calculation properly aggregates margin used from all individual positions to provide accurate total balance (available + margin used).

## Data Storage Solutions
The system uses in-memory storage with an `IStorage` interface, prepared for future integration with PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM. The schema defines models for users, Bitget credentials, futures data, positions, and account information.

## Authentication and Authorization
A basic structure for user management is in place, including a user schema for username/password authentication, secure storage for Bitget API keys, and preparation for PostgreSQL session storage.

## UI/UX Decisions
The application prioritizes a clean, professional design optimized for mobile devices, matching modern trading interfaces. It features a bottom navigation bar, collapsible folder views for organization, and intuitive interfaces for trading pair management, bot deployment, and AI-powered recommendations. shadcn/ui components ensure consistent visual style. AI-powered features include color-coded risk levels, confidence ratings, and strategy-specific icons.

## Technical Implementations
Key technical implementations include real-time data streaming via WebSockets, a comprehensive trading pair organization system with folder management and bulk bot deployment, and an AI-powered trading opportunity recommendation system. The AI analyzes price movements, volume patterns, and risk factors across multiple strategies (Momentum, Breakout, Scalping, Swing, Reversal) to provide smart scoring and confidence ratings. The bot system uses reusable strategy templates with configurable technical indicators and risk management settings.

**Enhanced Multi-Indicator AI Bot System (August 2025)**: FULLY OPERATIONAL sophisticated technical analysis engine combining 6 indicators with weighted scoring - MACD crossover/momentum detection, RSI oversold/overbought levels, Bollinger Bands squeeze/breakout analysis, volume-price relationship assessment, moving average golden/death crosses, and support/resistance proximity analysis. Each indicator contributes weighted scores (totaling 100%) with adaptive confidence thresholds (25-50% based on signal strength). CONFIRMED LIVE EXECUTION: System actively placing both LONG and SHORT trades with real-time indicator analysis. Recent successful trades include BASUSDT LONG (35% confidence) and TRXUSDT SHORT (25% confidence). System provides detailed indicator breakdown, confidence ratings, and supports both position directions with proper risk management.
